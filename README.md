# Temperature-Controlled-Fan-PIC18F

## Description:

#### This project was done on MPLabX using the XC compiler and simulation is done on Proteus.

 
#### The project has a very simple operation, as it checks for the LM35 sensor reading every 100 milliseconds and takes actions based on this value.


  

#### Temperature below 70 will turn off the fan.
#### Temperature from 70 to 80 will rotate the motor at 25% speed.
#### Temperature from 81 to 93 will rotate the motor at 50% speed.
#### Temperature above 93 will rotate the motor at 100% speed.
